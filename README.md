## :scroll: Description
<!--- Describe your app in one or two sentences -->

An entry to the Android Dev Challenge, Week 1.

## :bulb: Motivation and Context
<!--- Optionally point readers to interesting parts of your submission. -->
<!--- What are you especially proud of? -->

For now this is pretty simple and fulfills just the bare minimum requirements. Two screens which you can navigate between.
Since I am pretty new to Compose and to Navigation as well this wasn't as easy as I liked but I guess every start is hard.

I would like to expand this app with some more points:
 * [ ] Add more doggos
 * [ ] Add theming with some nice colors
 * [ ] Fill the details page with additional dog informations

## Code formatting
The CI uses Spotless to check if your code is formatted correctly and contains the right licenses. 
Internally, Spotless uses ktlint to check the formatting of your code. 
To set up ktlint correctly with Android Studio, follow one of the listed setup options.

Before committing your code, run `./gradlew app:spotlessApply` to automatically format your code.
